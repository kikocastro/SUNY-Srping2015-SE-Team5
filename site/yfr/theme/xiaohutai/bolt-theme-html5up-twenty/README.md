### Introduction

This is [Twenty by HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/twenty) adapted for Bolt! See `README.txt` for notes by the original author of this theme.

### Configuration

Check out `config.yml` for some additional settings. Do not forget to clear your cache in Bolt every time you make changes.

This theme has a custom template with pagination for overviews and search results. For your records, you should pick from:

 * `record.twig` (no sidebar)
 * `record-sidebar-left.twig`
 * `record-sidebar-right.twig`

You can define what entries or pages should be fetched in the sidebar, by defining the query in `config.yml`.

### Contact Page

[2014.10.18] Work in progress.

Enable the **SimpleForms** and define a form with the name `contact` or modify in `contact.twig`.
Do not forget to assign a page with the `contact.twig` template.
